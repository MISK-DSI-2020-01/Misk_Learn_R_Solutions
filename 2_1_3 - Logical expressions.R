# 2.1.3 - Logical expressions
# Misk Academy Data Science Immersive, 2020

# Logical expressions are how we
# Ask and combine TRUE/FALSE questions

# Asking questions ----
# There a 6 Relational Operators
# Can you list them?


# Plus we have a special case in R:
# !x, where x is a logical vector, give the negation of x
!c(T, F, T, T, T)


# Combining questions ----
# There are 2 typical Logical Operators
# Can you name them?


# There is one more R-specific logical operator
# %in% WITHIN

## Number one thing to remember:
## You will ALWAYS get a logical vector whenever you see a relational or logical operator

# Examples with foo_df: Logical data ----
# All healthy observations



# All unhealthy observations



# Examples with foo_df: Numeric data
# Below quantity 10



# Tails (beyond 10 and 20)



# Impossible



# Middle (between 10 and 20)



# Meaningless



# What really happened
# We asked two questions:


# Examples with foo_df: Character data
# NO PATTERN MATCHING so we have to use exact matches
# All heart observations



# All heart and liver observations
# Cheap and easy way:



# What if... our query was in a vector?
query <- c("Heart", "Liver")
# How can we combine many == and |



# to compare, NEVER DO THIS!!!
# This doesn't work:
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == query)
# But this does: i.e. reverse the query
foo_df %>% 
  filter(tissue == rev(query))
